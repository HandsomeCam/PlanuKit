PlanuKit
========

PlanuKit is an Objective-C library for consuming the [Planets.Nu][1] game API. The project builds a iOS static library as well as a Framework for OS X.

**ARC**
---

PlanuKit requires ARC to be enabled in the project. No effort to support non-ARC projects is currently planned.

**CoreData**
--------

PlanuKit uses CoreData to save the game data locally. For iOS projects using the static library, include the *NuData.xcdatamodeld* from PlanuKit in the resources of the app.
